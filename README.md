# Determination-of-a-profitable-2-bedroom-investment-in-NYC-using-Airbnb-and-Zillow-Data-



You are consulting for a real estate company that has a niche in purchasing properties to
rent out short-term as part of their business model specifically within New York City. The
real estate company has already concluded that two bedroom properties are the most
profitable; however, they do not know which zip codes are the best to invest in.
The real estate company has engaged your firm to build out a data product and provide
your conclusions to help them understand which zip codes would generate the most
profit on short term rentals within New York City.
